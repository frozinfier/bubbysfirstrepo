# stay_hydrated_bot

An old Node.js Discord bot I made in high school/first year of university that gives reminders on how often and how much water you should be drinking. Not currently in a useable state after taking it down from glitch.com.

Bot Commands:
h!help - brings up the list of commands the bot can take

h!hydrate - opts into the reminders

h!dehydrate - opts out of the reminders

h!interval [number] - customise how often you receive the reminders

h!dm - toggles whether you receive reminders via the server's designated "hydration_room" or via direct message.

TODO list: shorter reminders, make the reminders persistent whenever the glitch.com unexpectedly resets the bot, better exception handling, make online status/daily reminder status/ timeouts attributes? serverwide settings as an object to allow for things like changing the hydration rooms and setting a global default constant for new users
